        <h1 class="blog-title">Restoring an iPhone SE 2020</h1>
        <p class="blog-date">Posted on November 3, 2024</p>

        <p class="blog-text">
            I recently stumbled upon my sister's old iPhone SE 2020 tucked away in a drawer. It had seen better days; the phone
            was mangled, and the screen and frame were bent out of shape. This model was a couple of years old, but the parts to replace it were rather cheap.
            The reason I wanted to restore this device is that I started developing an app, and I wanted to be able to see how it would look on iOS. So, I decided to embark on a restoration project to bring this little device back to life for testing functionality.

        <h2>Step 1: The Disassembly</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            The first step was completely disassembling the device into all its components. I had to assess the damage; luckily, the motherboard was
            completely intact, which is why I decided to continue with the project. When I unscrewed the bottom and took off the screen,
            the bottom of the phone fell apart because the frame was so destroyed that the lower half of the phone was detached.
            The damaged components were the following:

        <ul class="blog-list">
            <li>Cracked front screen</li>
            <li>Metal frame split in two</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Gathering the Parts</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            I managed to get a screen from AliExpress for $3 and a frame for $22 after a quick search.

        <h2>The Restoration Process</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Working on any smartphone, especially from Apple, can be challenging due to their complicated internals and small components.
            I took off each piece, making sure to keep track of the screws since I would be placing them back. After I extracted the components,
            I moved on to the new frame, which I got in red, my favorite color. I carefully placed each component back into its 
            proper location, making sure not to be too harsh on the ribbon cables, which are very delicate.

        <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            After reassembling, I started to get nervous at this point, wondering if I had made any mistakes. I placed the new screen into 
            the frame. The exterior was so clean that you could not tell the phone had been nearly split in half.
            I pressed the power button and was thrilled to see the Apple logo appear. 
            The new screen surprised me for being so cheap.

        <h2>Before and After</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            The transformation was remarkable; the iPhone looked almost brand new. Here's a side-by-side comparison:

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            This project was both fun and educational. I gained a deeper understanding of smartphone hardware 
            and the satisfaction of breathing new life into an old device. 
            Plus, it's an eco-friendly way to reuse electronics instead of contributing to e-waste.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            If you have an old device lying around, consider restoring it or donating it. Not only can you save money,
            but you also reduce environmental impact. Just make sure to take your time with the process.
