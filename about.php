            Hello! My Name is Sergio Mercado Nu√±ez. This is my first website using PHP, HTML, and CSS, 
            and it's now live on the internet! I am a computer engineering student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
            I love learning about computers and how they work!
            My most recent obsession has been VHDL, and I am currently working on a Gameboy Hardware Emulator using it.	
            I am also currently working as a Research Assistant at the Golisano Institute of Technology.
            The project that I created for the research is a tool called PLEXOS to Bokeh Pivot(P2BP) 
            written in Python. I love the feeling of performing and dancing mexican folk since
            I get to spread my beautiful culture .
            I also love my pet dog Oreo 
        </p>
