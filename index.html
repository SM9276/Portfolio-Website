		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p> Hello! This is my first website using PHP, HTML, and CSS, and it's now live on the internet!
		I am a computer engineering student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
		I love learning about computers and how they work!
		My most recent obsession has been VHDL,  and I am currently working on a 
		Gameboy Hardware Emulator using it.	
		I am also working as a Research Assistant at the Golisano Institute of Technology.
		The project that I created for the research is a tool called PLEXOS to Bokeh Pivot(P2BP) 
		written in Python. I love the feeling of performing and dancing mexican folk since
		I get to spread my beautiful culture .
		I also love my pet dog Oreo
